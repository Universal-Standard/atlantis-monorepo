# ATLANTIS Monorepo 🤖

The ATLANTIS AI made portable - A fully automated, self-healing software development system.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository implements a **completely automated** software development workflow that handles the entire lifecycle from issue detection to production deployment. All processes are automated, self-healing, and require zero manual intervention.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Automated Issue Detection
- **Daily automated scans** using CodeQL and GitHub Copilot
- Automatically detects:
  - Missing documentation
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Code quality issues
  - Missing best practices
  - License and compliance issues

### 🔧 Automated Issue Resolution
- **Intelligent solution generation** based on issue analysis
- Automatic branch creation and code changes
- Generated fixes follow best practices and conventions
- Creates pull requests with detailed documentation

### ✅ Automated Review & Validation
- **Comprehensive automated review** of all changes
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting, standards)
- Security scanning (secrets, vulnerabilities)
- Documentation validation
- Automated approval when all checks pass

### 🔄 Automated Merge & Deployment
- **Auto-merge** approved pull requests to main
- Squash commits for clean history
- Automatic branch cleanup
- Closes related issues automatically

### 🏥 Self-Healing System
- **Continuous health monitoring** (runs every 6 hours)
- Detects and resolves:
  - Stuck pull requests
  - Stale issues
  - Failed workflows
- Automatic retry and recovery mechanisms

### 📋 Project Board Automation
- **Automatic issue tracking** through lifecycle
- Status labels: `new` → `in-progress` → `completed` → `archived`
- Links PRs to issues automatically
- Archives completed work

1. 🔍 DETECTION
   └─→ CodeQL & Copilot scan for issues
   └─→ Create GitHub issue with details
   
2. 🔧 RESOLUTION  
   └─→ Analyze issue requirements
   └─→ Generate solution automatically
   └─→ Create fix branch & apply changes
   └─→ Create pull request
   
3. ✅ REVIEW
   └─→ Run code quality checks
   └─→ Security scanning
   └─→ Documentation validation
   └─→ Auto-approve if all pass
   
4. 🚀 MERGE
   └─→ Auto-merge to main
   └─→ Close related issue
   └─→ Clean up branch
   └─→ Archive documentation
   
5. 🏥 SELF-HEAL
   └─→ Monitor system health
   └─→ Detect stuck processes
   └─→ Retry failed operations
   └─→ Alert on critical issues

        ALL AUTOMATED • ALL SELF-HEALING

## 🎯 Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
- **Daily at midnight UTC** - Issue detection scan
- **Every 6 hours** - Self-healing health check
- **On push to main** - Issue detection scan
- **On issue opened** - Automatic resolution
- **On PR opened** - Automatic review
- **On workflow failure** - Self-healing recovery

### Manual Triggers
All workflows support manual dispatch via GitHub Actions UI for testing or forced execution.

## 🔐 Security

- **CodeQL security scanning** integrated into detection
- **Automated secret detection** in review process
- **Security policy** (SECURITY.md) for reporting vulnerabilities
- **Automated security updates** for dependencies

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Required Permissions
The workflows require the following GitHub permissions:
- `contents: write` - For creating branches and commits
- `issues: write` - For managing issues
- `pull-requests: write` - For creating and merging PRs
- `security-events: write` - For CodeQL scanning
- `actions: write` - For triggering workflows

### Customization
All workflows are configurable via GitHub Actions UI:
- Adjust scan schedules in workflow YAML files
- Customize issue detection rules
- Modify review criteria
- Configure merge strategies

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Checks
The self-healing system monitors:
- ✅ Workflow success rates
- ⏱️ PR merge times
- 📝 Issue resolution times
- 🔄 System recovery events

### Alerts
Automatic alerts are created for:
- Multiple workflow failures (3+ in 24h)
- PRs stuck for >24 hours
- Issues stale for >48 hours
